This programm have Caesar encryption, when the client is turned on, in the form of a login, the user must enter the key by which messages will be encrypted, login, and password, login and password are transferred to the database, in this case I used the Sqlite database to the second user saw the messages sent by the first user, he needs to enter the same key, if he enters other keys, all messages he will see are encrypted, there is also a userlist that displays the clients who are in the chat.
